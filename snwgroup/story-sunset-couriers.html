      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p class="desc">The city hummed in violet and gold as Ari tightened their helmet strap. “We’ve got forty minutes before the bridge lights cut off. Think we make it?”</p>
      <p class="desc">“If you stop overthinking,” Sol grinned, nudging Ari’s bike with their own. They balanced a sealed envelope in their jacket—an apology letter Ari wrote but couldn’t deliver alone.</p>
      <p class="desc">They weaved through traffic, tires singing on wet asphalt. Every red light was a tiny confession: Ari rehearsed what they’d say; Sol pretended not to hear and quietly hoped the letter was for them. Overhead, trains rattled like an impatient heartbeat.</p>
      <p class="desc">Halfway across the river, wind whipped the envelope loose. Sol caught it with a laugh that tasted like relief. “You’re allowed to want things,” they said, tucking it back.</p>
      <p class="desc">By the time they reached the apartment, sunset had melted into violet. Ari’s hands shook, so Sol knocked for them. When the door opened, Ari blurted everything the letter forgot: the regret, the missing, the promise to do better.</p>
      <p class="desc">Later, coasting home under streetlamps, Sol finally asked, “Was any of that for me?” Ari’s smile cracked into something honest. “All of it is. Stay for tea?”</p>
