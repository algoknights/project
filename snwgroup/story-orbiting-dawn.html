      <p class="desc">A quiet engineer is paired with a fallen prince on a silent-run cargo ship. Slow-burn banter, found family, and an AI that ships them harder than the crew does.</p>

      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p class="desc">On deck twelve, the AI dimmed the stars so the prince could sleep. The engineer stayed anyway, humming old flight songs only the ship could hear. They traced the constellations on the viewport, mapping routes the court would never approve.</p>
      <p class="desc">“You’re awake,” the prince whispered, voice barely above the hum of the reactor.</p>
      <p class="desc">“Systems never really sleep,” the engineer said. “Neither do people who plan to steal a kingdom back.”</p>
      <p class="desc">The prince let out a laugh that sounded like relief wearing a disguise. “You think we can really do it?”</p>
      <p class="desc">“We already are,” the engineer replied, pointing to the cargo bay where the crew practiced silent drills. The AI pulsed a soft lavender across the walls—a quiet vote of confidence—and somewhere below, someone tuned a cracked radio to drown their nerves in old love songs.</p>
      <p class="desc">Later, when alarms briefly flickered, the engineer covered the prince’s shaking hands with their own. “We’ll rewrite the flight plan as many times as it takes. Dawn’s not a place,” they said. “It’s a choice we keep making together.”</p>
