      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p class="desc">Ink smudged like moonlight, the script curled in a way only one person wrote—someone the courier should not have missed. Every night, they carried messages between towers that refused to share hallways, much less heartbeats.</p>
      <p class="desc">Tonight, the letter weighed heavier, spelled with a new urgency. <em>Meet me where the wards thin. I am tired of walls. —L.</em></p>
      <p class="desc">The courier tucked the parchment against their chest and sprinted through moonlit courtyards. Lanterns blinked awake as if cheering them on. By the time they reached the old archway, the wards shimmered, listening.</p>
      <p class="desc">On the other side, L stood with ink-stained fingers and a nervous smile. “I kept writing so I wouldn’t forget what my own voice sounded like,” they confessed.</p>
      <p class="desc">“Then let’s talk until sunrise,” the courier said, offering a hand. The wards parted—slowly, stubbornly, finally—and the towers that once kept them apart had to listen as two writers rewrote their own truce aloud.</p>
