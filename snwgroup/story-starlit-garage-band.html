      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p class="desc">The garage smelled like oil, citrus cleaner, and possibility. June wiped grease from her cheek with the back of her hand and strummed a chord to see if the amp still buzzed. It did.</p>
      <p class="desc">“We fix engines, we fix sound,” Malik said, tightening a bolt on the drum kit made from repurposed hubcaps. Their laughter bounced off concrete walls, too big for the room.</p>
      <p class="desc">After midnight, they climbed to the roof. String lights tangled around old antennae, city lights blinking like they were keeping tempo. Theo unpacked a notebook. “I wrote something on the bus ride,” he offered, shy as a first chord.</p>
      <p class="desc">They played until neighbors opened windows instead of filing complaints. The song wasn’t polished, but it was honest: a chorus about engines that don’t quit and people who choose each other when the world doesn’t. June’s voice cracked on the last line; no one minded.</p>
      <p class="desc">When the music faded, they sat in the warm hush that follows a good set. “Tour someday?” Malik asked.</p>
      <p class="desc">“We’re already moving,” Theo said, nodding at the stars. The night smelled like rain and new starts, and for the first time, the alley felt wide enough for their dreams.</p>
