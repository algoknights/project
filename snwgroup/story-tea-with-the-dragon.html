      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p class="desc">Scales shimmered under the cafe’s warm lights as claws carefully etched a fern into foam. The regulars thought the new barista had the steadiest hands in town. No one knew those hands could also lift a cottage.</p>
      <p class="desc">A kid pressed their face to the counter. “How do you make the leaves so real?”</p>
      <p class="desc">The dragon smiled, steam curling like smoke. “Patience. And a promise not to scorch the milk.” Laughter rippled through the line, breaking the morning’s chill.</p>
      <p class="desc">By afternoon, the dragon swapped to a smaller form to fit the backroom stool, practicing latte art hearts until their claws cramped. A coworker slid them a honey bun. “Breaks are part of the craft,” she said.</p>
      <p class="desc">Outside, rain tapped the windows. Inside, the dragon brewed warmth, learning the rhythm of human laughter one latte at a time—and realizing that maybe, just maybe, this was what hoarding happiness could look like.</p>
