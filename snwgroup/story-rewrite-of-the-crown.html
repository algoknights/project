      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p class="desc">The blade lowered, the truth unraveling like the royal banners—stitched by the wrong hands. The accused “villain” met the heir’s eyes and said, “Check the ledger sewn into your mother’s cloak.”</p>
      <p class="desc">Pages of intercepted letters spilled out, proving years of sabotage aimed at both of them. The court gasped; the heir reached out; the former villain laughed softly, relief mixing with defiance.</p>
      <p class="desc">“Rewrite with me?” they asked.</p>
      <p class="desc">The heir hesitated only long enough to throw the blade aside. In its place, they offered a pen. “Let’s fix what we both inherited.”</p>
      <p class="desc">Together, they redrafted the laws late into the night, ink drying on promises of chosen family and power shared, not hoarded. Outside the palace, crowds read the new decrees by lantern light and, for the first time, believed the crown could listen.</p>
